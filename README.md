## Installation

After cloning repo , enter 'node index.js' in terminal to start up the server. A 'App Listening' confirmation message will display.

## Usage

To use and make your own API calls using Insomnia first, start up server. Use the routes listed in the routes index.js file to add/update or delete  data such as Users, Thoughts, Friends and Reactions. 

## Resources

When it came to initial building of the app, I reference this week 18 mini project. 
My tutor Katie Redford helped me troubleshoot some server issues and the user api route calls. AskBCS also helped resolved some model errors that displayed in insomnia.
